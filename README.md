# Black-Jack
A console Black Jack game in Python

The deck is unlimited in size.

Has no Joker cards. Have thought that Jack, Queen and King should be 10 of which I have several 10 in my deck (list/array). This means that the probability of getting 10 is four times greater compared to the other cards. When a card is drawn from the deck, it is not removed but remains in the deck.



Spades will start counting as 11 until the user gets over 21.



Has a deal_card function that uses the list and returns a random card.



To be able to use the random function, it was necessary to import random



Have used a clear function so it is cleared and becomes easy to read when you have to restart the game.
